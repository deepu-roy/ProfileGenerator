   - Reduced server load

2. **Print CSS Optimization** - Dedicated `@media print` styles:

   - `@page { size: A4 landscape; margin: 0; }` for edge-to-edge
   - `print-color-adjust: exact` for accurate color reproduction
   - Explicit color values with `!important` to override browser defaults
   - Reduced padding/margins (8px wrap, 10px hero, 14px cards)

3. **Multiple File Upload** - Changed from single to multiple uploads:
   - `upload.single('photo')` → `upload.fields([...])`
   - Supports profile photo + 2 company logos
   - Each logo displays in footer with max-width/max-height constraints
